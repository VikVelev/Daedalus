# Daedalus
This is in highly experimental phase.
## Procedural 3D Object Generation with GANs

Contains desktop client application and a backend server, which isn't hosted anywhere for now.
The backend requires a lot of configuration so:
  TODO: 
    - Create a docker container and deploy
    - Write this README so it contains enough info
    
If you want notes on how to get it working, or neural network architectures, and other ML related info contact me at viktorvelev8@gmail.com
